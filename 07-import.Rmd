# Exercise
1. What is the difference between a data.frame and tibble? How do you convert between them?
1. Import the bike counts data for Hawthorne and Tilikum in Microsoft Excel format;
1. Import the Portland weather data in csv format;
1. [Challenge] Import the Portland weather data in fixed width format;
1. For those already familiar with R, create a R script that loads, cleans, and visualizes the bike counts data as well as temperature and precipitation data (using data from Weather Station `USC00356750`); <p>
for those not yet familiar with R, think about how you would go about doing these tasks with the software you are most comfortable with.
