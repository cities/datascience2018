# Exercise

[Link to the README file for the data](https://github.com/cities/datascience2018/blob/master/data/README.md)

1. What is the difference between a data.frame and tibble? How do you convert between them?
1. Import the bike counts data for the three bridges in Microsoft Excel format;
1. Import the [Portland weather data in csv format](https://github.com/cities/datascience2018/raw/master/data/NCDC-CDO-USC00356750.csv);
1. [Challenge] Import the [Portland weather data in fixed width format](https://github.com/cities/datascience2018/raw/master/data/NCDC-CDO-USC00356750.txt);
1. For those already familiar with R, create a R script that loads, cleans, and visualizes the bike counts data as well as temperature and precipitation data (using data from Weather Station `USC00356750`); <p>
for those not yet familiar with R, think about how you would go about doing these tasks with the software you are most comfortable with.
