# Split-Apply-Combine
<img alt="Split-Apply-Combine" style="border-width:0" src="http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/fig/12-plyr-fig1.png" />

A common analytical pattern is to:

- split data into pieces,
- apply some function to each piece,
- combine the results back together again.

Generally avoid using loops when you need to do Split-Apply-Combine, consider these alternatives instead:

1. Entry level: `dplyr::group_by()`
1. General approach: nesting
1. `*aplly` functions and `plyr` package (non-tidyverse solution)

# Exercise
1. Fit linear regression models of the daily bike counts on percipitation and max temperature, first for both bridges together and then for each bridge separately using the split-apply-combine pattern;
1. When using ggfortify to plot weekly variation, trend and noise separately, you need to plot each bridge separately (sample code [here](code/visualize_bikecounts.R)). Use the split-apply-combine to avoid having to repeat for each bridge.
