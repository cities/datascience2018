# Tidy Data
There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

- Each variable must have its own column.
- Each observation must have its own row.
- Each value must have its own cell.

That interrelationship leads to an even simpler set of practical instructions:

- Put each dataset in a tibble.
- Put each variable in a column.
