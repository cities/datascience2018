# Tidy Data
There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

- Each variable must have its own column.
- Each observation must have its own row.
- Each value must have its own cell.

That interrelationship leads to an even simpler set of practical instructions:

- Put each dataset in a tibble.
- Put each variable in a column.

# Exercise
1. Are the bike counts data tidy data?
1. If not, why not? And how can we tidy it?
1. Convert the total bike counts data to a wide format, with each row representing a day, and a column representing the total bike counts for each of the three bridges;
1. Convert the above data frame in wide format back to long format. 
1. [Challenge] After tidying the bike counts, using functions in the `tidyr` package, create tables summarizing the average bike counts by bridge and day of week in two different formats:


```{r tab-format1, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
counts_dow <- tribble(
  ~Bridge, ~Sun, ~Mon, ~Tue, ~Wed, ~Thur, ~Fri, ~Sat,
  "Hawthorne", NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,
  "Tilikum", NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA
) 

counts_dow %>% 
  pander::pander(caption="Bike Counts by Day of Week and Bridge (1st Format)",
                 missing="")
```

```{r tab-format2, echo=FALSE}
counts_dow %>% 
  tidyr::gather(key="Day of Week", value="counts", Sun:Sat) %>% 
  tidyr::spread(Bridge, counts) %>% 
  pander::pander(caption="Bike Counts by Day of Week and Bridge (2nd Format)",
                 missing="")
```
