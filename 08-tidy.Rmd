# Tidy Data
There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

- Each variable must have its own column.
- Each observation must have its own row.
- Each value must have its own cell.

That interrelationship leads to an even simpler set of practical instructions:

- Put each dataset in a tibble.
- Put each variable in a column.

# Exercise
1. Are the bike counts data tidy data?
1. If not, why not? And how can we tidy it?
1. Convert the total bike counts data to a wide format, with each row representing a day, and a column representing the total bike counts for each of the three bridges;
1. Convert the above data frame in wide format back to long format.
