- Description: Global Historical Climate Network includes daily land surface observations from around the world. The GHCN-Daily was developed to meet the needs of climate analysis and monitoring studies that require data at a sub-monthly time resolution (e.g., assessments of the frequency of heavy rainfall, heat wave duration, etc.). The dataset includes observations from World Meteorological Organization, Cooperative, and CoCoRaHS networks. If observed, the station dataset includes max and minimum temperatures, total precipitation, snowfall, and depth of snow on ground. Some U.S. station data are typically delayed only 24 hours.

- Note
   - Hawthorne
       - 2012 - 7/30/2018
       - some of the missing/low counts may have been updated since the last batch I sent you – still several periods of incomplete data starting fall 2017-present
   - Tilikum
       - 2015-yesterday
       - Still unofficial – I just record it from the TriMet website; also note a few holes in the data where only one side is collecting (generally just a few days at a time)
   - Steel
       - Dec 2013-Jul 2017
       - One counter for lower River Walk (2-way bike traffic) plus two for upper portion, north & south sides; Most of 2014 & 2015 is complete for all three but lots of holes otherwise
